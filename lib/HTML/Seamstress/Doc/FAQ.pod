=head1 Philosophy 

=head2 Since you're using 'id' attributes to rewrite elements, you can't put a single value in multiple places

I would recommend using a class attribute or custom attribute. I often use klass myself.

=head2 It looks like you are using id and class tags to find and rewrite parts of HTML

Well, we can use id and class tags to find and rewrite parts of HTML.  But in fact, we can do anything the L<HTML::Element> look_down
method can do to find elements.

=head2 What the freak is guts()? highlander()? passover?

They are tree processing methods. Seamstress is an open-ended API for OO tree processing. Here are good places to search for methods:

=over 4

=item * L<HTML::TreeBuilder>

=item * L<HTML::Element>

=item * L<HTML::Element::Library>

=item * L<HTML::Element::Replacer>

=cut

=head2 What does HTML::Seamstress inherit from?

It inherits from L<HTML::TreeBuilder> and L<HTML::Element> and it uses
L<HTML::Element::Library>. It probably should use L<HTML::Element::Replacer> as well!
