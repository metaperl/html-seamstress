<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>HTML::Seamstress::Quickstart - A gentle introduction to HTML::Seamstress</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This guide is designed to get you started with dynamically generating
and modifying (``templating'') HTML with
<a href="/HTML/Seamstress.html">HTML::Seamstress</a>.</p>
<p>We will work through several examples, with each one increasing your
ability to work with Seamstress effectively.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="sample_files">Sample files</a></h2>
<p>All the files for the samples are in the directory
<em>lib/HTML/Seamstress/Quickstart</em></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="pure_treebuilder">Pure TreeBuilder</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the first example. This is our bare-bones example. Let's
say we want to dynamically modify the following HTML:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;html&gt;
 
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Greetings&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
 
   &lt;body&gt;
 
     &lt;h1&gt;Greetings&lt;/h1&gt;
 
     Hello there &lt;span id=name&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;, your lucky number is
       &lt;span id=lucky_number&gt;666&lt;/span&gt;
 
   &lt;/body&gt;
 
 &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>Let's not use Seamstress at all in this case. Remember Seamstress just
makes using <a href="/HTML/Tree.html">HTML::Tree</a> more convenient when writing
software - it is completely optional and totally non-magical. So
here's the (admittedly verbose) pure TreeBuilder solution:</p>
<pre>
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use HTML::TreeBuilder;
 
 my $name   = 'Redd Foxx';
 my $number = 887;
 
 my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new_from_file('html/greeting.html');
 
 my $name_elem = $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; 'name');
 $name_elem-&gt;delete_content;
 $name_elem-&gt;push_content($name);
 
 my $number_elem = $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; 'lucky_number');
 $number_elem-&gt;delete_content;
 $number_elem-&gt;push_content($number);
 
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>There's a convenience function in 
<a href="/HTML/Element/Library.html">HTML::Element::Library</a> which
makes it easy to replace all the content of an element. This will make
our script shorter. If we simply use Seamstress, its
<code>new_from_file()</code> method will bless the
HTML tree into a class which inherits from HTML::Element::Library,
making it easy for us to shorten our program. So let's rework the
example using bare-bones Seamstress.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="base_bones_seamstress_rework">Base bones Seamstress rework</a></h1>
<p>Since we used HTML::Seamstress instead of HTML::TreeBuilder, our
<code>$tree</code> was blessed as an instance of <code>HTML::Seamstress</code>. Since
<code>HTML::Seamstress</code> inherits from <code>HTML::TreeBuilder</code> and
<code>HTML::Element::Library</code>, we have a <code>$tree</code> which can use the
methods of both.</p>
<p>We will take advantage of the <code>replace_content</code> method in 
<a href="/HTML/Element/Library.html">HTML::Element::Library</a> to shorten our
program:</p>
<pre>
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use HTML::Seamstress;
 
 my $name   = 'Redd Foxx';
 my $number = 887;
 
 my $tree = HTML::Seamstress-&gt;new_from_file('html/greeting.html');
 
 
 my $elem = $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; 'name');
 $elem-&gt;replace_content($name);
 
 $elem = $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; 'lucky_number');
 $elem-&gt;replace_content($number);
 
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>Now of course, this program is just itching to not repeat itself, so
we will clean it up just a tad:</p>
<pre>
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use HTML::Seamstress;
 
 my $name    = 'Redd Foxx';
 my $number  = 887;
 
 my $tree    = HTML::Seamstress-&gt;new_from_file('html/greeting.html');
 
 
 my %replace = (
   name         =&gt; $name,
   lucky_number =&gt; $number
  );
 
 
 $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; $_)-&gt;replace_content($replace{$_})
     for (keys %replace) ;
 
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="abstract_the_file_and_our_operations_on_it_into_a_perl_loom">Abstract the file and our operations on it into a Perl LOOM</a></h1>
<p>Ok sweet, we have a nice tight program. But is this really
application-level code? As the user of ultra-scaffolded frameworks
such as <a href="/Class/DBI.html">Class::DBI</a> and <em>Catalyst</em>, I can say
no. Our inline code must
be much tighter. It must do no more than <code>use</code>, <code>new</code>, and <code>operation()</code>
whatever <code>operation()</code> may be.</p>
<p>The key abstraction technique of the uber-modules is a
package. Normally a package collects together a set of methods. In our
case, it is collecting together an HTML file and the object-oriented
operations on it. <strong>alert, alert: acronym, alert</strong> from this point
forward, a Perl class 
abstracting a file and tree operations on the file will be called a
<em>LOOM</em> - (L)ibrary (O)f (O)bject-oriented (M)ethods for HTML
files.</p>
<p>On the whole, there are two ways to build a <code>LOOM</code>. The quick and dirty
way is to stick a <em>.pm</em> file in the same directory as the html
file. This is fine for most purposes and is what I like to use.</p>
<p>However in some cases it is not desirable or possible for the 
HTML and Perl to be in the same directory. This is the slow and clean
approach, which does have some additional advantages which will be
discussed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="quick_and_dirty_loom_building___pm_and__html_in_same_directory">Quick and dirty LOOM building: .pm and .html in same directory</a></h2>
<p>We have an <code>html::Greeting</code> module like this:</p>
<pre>
 package html::Greeting;
 
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use base qw(HTML::Seamstress);
 
 
 sub new {
   my $tree  = __PACKAGE__-&gt;new_from_file('html/greeting.html');
   $tree;
 }
 
 
 sub process {
   
   my $tree = shift;
 
   my %replace = (
     name         =&gt; 'Jim Rays',
     lucky_number =&gt; 222
    );
 
   $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; $_)-&gt;replace_content($replace{$_})
     for (keys %replace) ;
 }
 
 
 1;</pre>
<p>which we make nice tight application-level use of like this:</p>
<pre>
 use html::Greeting;
 
 my $tree = html::Greeting-&gt;new;
 
 $tree-&gt;process;
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="cleaning_up_our_perl_class">Cleaning up our Perl class</a></h3>
<p>We are flowing smoothly now with nice tight code in our
application. But should we be happy with this module? I see a few
drawbacks which require improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_our_file_name_is_given_as_a_relative_path_name">our file name is given as a relative path name</a></strong>

<p>Relative paths are fine as long as we are certain to start in the same
directory, but we cannot be sure of that when building applications,
so we need an absolute path.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_we_had_to_manually_create_this_package">we had to manually create this package</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>Let's fix the first problem first.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="make_path_to_html_file_absolute">Make path to HTML file absolute</a></h3>
<p>Again, Seamstress just happens to have a subroutine which guesses the
name of the HTML file associated with a Seamstress-style Perl module.
It is called <code>html()</code> and here we see it in use to give us the path
to our file in absolute fashion:</p>
<pre>
 package html::GreetingAbs;
 
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use base qw(HTML::Seamstress);
 
 use Data::Dumper;
 print Dumper \%INC;
 
 our $html = __PACKAGE__-&gt;html(__FILE__ , 'html'); 
 
 {
   last;
   
 # The stuff in these braces is not for the first reading of this!
 
 # $html is 
 # /ernest/dev/seamstress/lib/HTML/Seamstress/Quickstart/html/GreetingAbs.html
 # but the real HTML file is greeting.html not GreetingAbs.html
 $html =~ s!Abs!!;
 
 # change Greeting to greeting since file is greeting.html not Greeting.html
 $html =~ s!Greeting!greeting!;
 }
 
 
 
 sub new {
   my $tree  = __PACKAGE__-&gt;new_from_file($html);
   $tree;
 }
 
 
 sub process {
   
   my $tree = shift;
 
   my %replace = (
     name         =&gt; 'Jim Rays',
     lucky_number =&gt; 222
    );
 
   $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; $_)-&gt;replace_content($replace{$_})
     for (keys %replace) ;
 }
 
 
 1;</pre>
<p>and main code body is still the same:</p>
<pre>
 use html::GreetingAbs;
 
 my $tree = html::GreetingAbs-&gt;new;
 
 $tree-&gt;process;
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="slow_and_clean_loom_building___pm_and__html_in_different_directory">Slow and clean LOOM building: .pm and .html in different directory</a></h2>
<p>Here we need to slip a class in between <code>HTML::Seamstress</code> and our
LOOM:</p>
<pre>
 package Local::Seamstress::Base;
 
 use base qw(HTML::Seamstress);
 
 
 sub comp_root {
   '/ernest/dev/seamstress/lib/HTML/Seamstress/Quickstart/html';
 }
 
 1;</pre>
<p>This class will make it easy to track down the directory of our HTML
files.</p>
<p>The LOOM class inherits from it and makes use of it in its
constructor:</p>
<pre>
 package html::Greeting;
 
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 
 use base qw(Local::Seamstress::Base); # not HTML::Seamstress!
                                      # we need an intermediate base class
                                      # with the comp_root() method so that
                                      # we can get an absolute path to the 
                                      # HTML file... remember this is an
                                      # example where the LOOM is in a 
                                      # different directory to the the HTML
                                      # file it operates on.
 
 
 sub new {
   my $comp_root = __PACKAGE__-&gt;comp_root();
   my $html_file = &quot;$comp_root/greeting.html&quot;;
   warn &quot;html_file: $html_file&quot;;
   my $tree  = __PACKAGE__-&gt;new_from_file($html_file);
   $tree;
 }
 
 
 sub process {
   
   my $tree = shift;
 
   my %replace = (
     name         =&gt; 'Slow Clean Greeting Machine',
     lucky_number =&gt; 737
    );
 
   $tree-&gt;look_down(id =&gt; $_)-&gt;replace_content($replace{$_})
     for (keys %replace) ;
 }
 
 
 1;</pre>
<p>And out main body code is just as tight. We have a few statements to
make sure to use the right version of <code>html::Greeting</code>, but other
than that, no changes:</p>
<pre>
 use lib 'lib';
 use html::Greeting;
 
 use Data::Dumper;
 
 print Dumper \%INC; # shows we are using the hhtml::Greeting which
                     # obtains its file via HTML::Seamstress::Base::comp_root()
                     # instead of via __PACKAGE__-&gt;html( )
 
 my $tree = html::Greeting-&gt;new;
 
 $tree-&gt;process;
 
 print $tree-&gt;as_HTML(undef, ' ');</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="slow_and_clean_has_extra_programming_advantages">Slow and clean has extra programming advantages</a></h3>
<p>Slow and clean is not just a different way to do the same
thing. By creating a local base class, you have full control over how
to connect an HTML file to your Perl code.</p>
<p>Your HTML designer can have his files mounted elsewhere. And you dont</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_infect_his_directory_with_your__2epm_files__3ditem">infect his directory with your <code>.pm</code> files
=item * infect his HTML with all sorts of dynamic HTML logic</a></strong>

</ul>
<p>And being infection-free is the way I like it.. in Perl and uhhh... other
endeavors.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="not_recommended_slow_clean_way__inline_the_html">Not recommended slow clean way: Inline the HTML</a></h3>
<p>There is no Seamstress API or utility support for this. But it is an
idea and I just wanted to mention it for completeness. You can create
a <em>.pm</em> with the HTML along the lines of this.</p>
<pre>
 package html::hello_world;</pre>
<pre>
 sub new {...}</pre>
<pre>
 sub process {...}</pre>
<pre>
 __HTML__
 &lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/body&gt;</pre>
<pre>
 &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>And then you could use <a href="/File/Slurp.html">File::Slurp</a> to read it in and 
submit an appropriate <code>HTML::Seamstress::new_from_content()</code> method
to do the proper blessings.</p>
<p>But I don't like this approach. It makes it hard to stay synchronized
with the designer as he continually makes updates.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="automated_creation_of_seamstressstyle_packages">Automated creation of Seamstress-style packages</a></h1>
<p>Instead of manually creating or copying and pasting packages to create
Seamstress-style packages, the <em>spkg.pl</em> script in the Seamstress
was off use. It is designed to help build the slow-clean LOOMs not the
quick-and-dirty ones.... it really should be updated to support either
usage mode.</p>

<h2><a name="use_subroutines_and_params__validate_to_componentize_your_operations">Use subroutines and Params::Validate to ``componentize'' your operations</a></h2>
<p>The final phase in Seamstress best practices is to break each tree
manipulation down into a separate subroutine whose parameters are
specified by <a href="/Params/Validate.html">Params::Validate</a>.</p>
<p>If you do this, then you can control the dynamic HTML generation by
parameterizing your subs properly. This advice will make more
sense as you do more complex things with Seamstress</p>
<p>Now you're ready for the big time! Have fun!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="identify_html_elements_by_class_tags_if_you_plan_to_loop_them">Identify HTML elements by class tags if you plan to loop them</a></h2>
<p>If your dummy HTML has a section which will be used as a sample and cloned
repeatedly (either by you manually or by an 
<a href="/HTML/Element/Library.html">HTML::Element::Library</a> method), then locate it
by a <code>class</code> tag and do not assign it an <code>id</code> tag. This is because HTML
becomes invalid when an id tag appears more than once in the same document.</p>
<p>For example here is some <em>Template</em> code:</p>
<pre>
 [% FOR column = item.columns('view') %]
    &lt;b class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;[% column %]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    [% item.$column %]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 [% END %]</pre>
<p>Here is how I converted it to a Seamstress document:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;span class=&quot;columns_view&quot;&gt;
    &lt;b class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;column_name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;item_column&quot;&gt;column_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;</pre>
